GOAL:

This project aims to predict the trend of the tempertaure in the next 100 years for two US cities; New-York and Los-Angeles. This project is not trying to predict the exact temperature at a specific date, rather to predict the frequency of heat waves in the future. By heat waves, I am considering a month where the average temperature is above a certain threshold.

DATA:

I am working with the NOAA climate data:
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/city/time-series/USH00305801/tavg/all/12/1895-2021?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1901&endbaseyear=2000
This allow to select a city and a date range for the average monthly temperature.

CODE:

CITY_NEW notebook is the core code, containing my project. It uses Scikit-Learn linear regression, with Time Series analysis.
