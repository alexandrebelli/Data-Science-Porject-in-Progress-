I am using the NASA NEX climate data: https://registry.opendata.aws/nasanex/ to predict the next population migration of the American population due to global warming and climate change. Particularly, I want to focus on the evolution of temperature for a set of big US cities and see if the temperature becomes too high and if these cities' lives become challenging.
